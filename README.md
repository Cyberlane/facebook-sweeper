Filter out some of Facebook's content

A good friend of mine is sensitive to some of the content on Facebook, so I made a simple TamperMonkey script which automatically collapses shared images on Facebook, still allowing you to read the text content. You are now given a button above where the image normally would be, giving you full control over if you want to see the picture or not.

This does not remove any of the content, this is not an adblocker, this simply will attempt to hide content before you see it!

Pull requests with improvements are welcomed!
